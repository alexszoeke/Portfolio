    <h2 class="margin">ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p>My name is Alex, I'm 26 years old, and currently a marketing specialist at PrimeroEdge, a software company in Houston, Texas designed to help school districts better manage nutition in their cafeterias in order to stay compliant with USDA regulations. I graduated from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in corporate communications and a minor in organizational leadership and supervision. While I enjoyed communications, it wasn't very challenging. I had learned some outdated HTML in one of my courses and really enjoyed it, so I expanded on that with UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp in Houston. It was extremely challenging, but so much fun to do. I love problem solving and having that "ah-hah!" or "light-bulb" moment. Combining my love of coding and marketing has pushed me to land on a career path I find joy in every single day. If you'd like the opportunity to get to know me better, <a href="/contact">contact</a> me anytime.</p>
