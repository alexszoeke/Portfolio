            <h4>Avid Rockets Fan</h4>
            <p>Most people go to bars, or musical festivals. I on the other hand find fun watching the Houston Rockets and attending as many home games as possible. </p>

            <h4>Volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House</h4>
            <p>Since January 2017, I've been a volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House. I commit 6 hours of my time per month there, where I help prep the overnight rooms for families to stay in when their children are in the ICU and don't want to be far away from them. I help keep the kitchen stocked and am available resource for any questions the families might have.</p>

            <h4>Family Oriented</h4>
            <p>It may seem silly to include a photo of my boyfriend on a portfolio site, but Jackson is a big part of my life and who I am. He's been my best friend since high school, and my partner for over four years. He is my family and makes big influences in my life everyday.</p>

            <h4>Cancer Advocate</h4>
            <p>I lost my father in October 2016 to <a href="https://cholangiocarcinoma.org/" target="_blank">Cholangiocarinoma</a>, otherwise known as bile duct cancer. My dad pushed me to make good decisions so I could be as successful in life possible. If there is anything anyone should ever know about me, it's the loss of my father changed me but that I work hard every single day for him. This isn't here to make anyone sad for me, or to feel any pity, but because it's about me and big part of who I am!</p>
