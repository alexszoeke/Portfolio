    <h2 class="margin">ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p>My name is Alex, I'm 28 years old, and currently a digital marketing specialist at PrimeroEdge, a software company in Houston, Texas designed to help school districts better manage nutition in their cafeterias in order to stay compliant with USDA regulations. I graduated from the University of Houston with a BA in Corporate Communications and a minor in Organizational Leadership and Supervision. While I enjoyed communications, I found that the curriculum wasn't very challenging. I had learned some outdated HTML in one of my courses and really enjoyed it, so I expanded on that with UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp in Houston. It was extremely challenging, but so much fun to do. I love problem solving and having that "ah-hah!" or "light-bulb" moment. This pushed me onto a career path as a digital marketing specialist, where I am able to combine my love of technology and marketing. If you'd like the opportunity to get to know me better, <a href="/contact">contact</a> me anytime.</p>
